clarinet test tests/holdly_test.ts
```

**Test Coverage:**

- ✅ Book addition with validation
- ✅ Borrow with correct STX deposit
- ✅ Return with automatic refund
- ✅ Error handling (invalid book ID, insufficient funds)
- ✅ Access control (only borrower can return their book)
- ✅ Multiple concurrent borrows

### Frontend Tests

```bash
npm test
```

**Component Tests:**

- ✅ Wallet connection flow
- ✅ Book listing and search
- ✅ Borrow transaction handling
- ✅ Return transaction handling
- ✅ Error state management

## 📚 Stacks Integration

This project leverages the following Stacks libraries and meets all Code4STX requirements:

### Stacks Libraries Used

- **@stacks/connect** (^8.2.4) - Wallet connection and authentication
- **@stacks/transactions** (^7.3.1) - Transaction construction and signing
- **@stacks/network** (^7.3.1) - Network configuration (testnet/mainnet)
- **Clarity** - Smart contract language for secure on-chain logic

### Validation

- ✅ All smart contracts written in Clarity
- ✅ Passes `clarinet check` validation
- ✅ Open-source and publicly available
- ✅ Uses native STX (no external dependencies)

- Explorer: [View on Stacks Explorer](https://explorer.hiro.so/address/ST3N8PR8ARF68BC45EDK4MWZ3WWDM74CFJAGZBY3K.holdlyv6?chain=testnet)
- Verified: ✅ Passes clarinet check
- Status: Active

## Usage

### Adding a Book

1. Connect your Stacks wallet
2. Navigate to "Add Book" tab
3. Enter book details (title, author, cover URL)
4. Set custom deposit amount (default: 1 STX)
5. Confirm transaction in wallet (free, only gas fees apply)

### Borrowing a Book

1. Browse available books
2. Click "Borrow Book"
3. Review deposit amount
4. Confirm STX deposit in wallet
5. Wait for transaction confirmation (~30 seconds)
6. Book appears in "My Borrows" tab

### Returning a Book

1. Go to "My Borrows" tab
2. Find your borrowed book
3. Click "Return Book & Get Deposit Back"
4. Confirm transaction in wallet
5. Receive automatic STX refund

## Use Cases

1. **Community Libraries** - Neighborhoods can create decentralized book sharing
2. **Academic Institutions** - Students can lend textbooks with deposit protection
3. **Collectors** - Rare book owners can safely lend valuable items
4. **Book Clubs** - Members can share books with collateral assurance
5. **Co-working Spaces** - Shared resource libraries with automatic accountability

## Security Considerations

✅ **Security Features:**

- Deposits held securely in smart contract
- Only borrowers can return their own books
- Automatic refunds prevent human error
- Native STX transfers (no external token dependencies)
- Type-safe Clarity smart contract
- Post-condition checks for transaction safety
- Immutable contract logic

⚠️ **Important Notes:**

- Always verify contract address before transactions
- Test with small amounts first
- Book owners cannot withdraw deposits (automatic refund only)
- Testnet tokens have no real value
