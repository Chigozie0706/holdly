Holdly is a decentralized peer-to-peer book lending marketplace built on Stacks. Book owners list their books with custom deposit amounts in STX or sBTC, and set their own borrow duration. Borrowers deposit collateral to borrow, which is automatically refunded on return. If a book is returned late, the deposit goes to the book owner. The platform is fully trustless — no intermediaries, no manual enforcement.

## 🚀 Live Demo

**Status**: 🟢 Live on Mainnet

**Live App**: [holdly-rho.vercel.app](https://holdly-rho.vercel.app/)

**Try it:**

1. Install [Leather Wallet](https://leather.io/) or [Xverse](https://www.xverse.app/)
2. Connect on mainnet
3. Browse books, donate a book, or borrow one

Holdly allows users to:

- **Donate books** to the decentralized library with custom deposit amounts, tokens, and borrow durations
- **Borrow books** by depositing STX or sBTC as collateral
- **Return books** and automatically receive their deposit back
- **Rate books** after returning them (1–5 stars)
